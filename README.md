This open source project aims to replicate some of the Google experience.

# Why

I wanted to create a replica of the Google homepage that captures the essence of its simplicity and functionality.

# Guide (Run Command)

1. Create a requirements.txt file: If you don't have one, create a new file named requirements.txt in your project.

2. Add Python 3: Add the following line to requirements.txt:
   python3

3. Install packages: In the terminal, run the following command:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   This will install Python 3, along with any other packages you might have listed in your requirements.

4. Update the run command: Now, your run command should be:
   run = "python3 -m http.server"

5. Save and deploy: Save both files and deploy your project.
   your project will now install the necessary packages and use Python 3 to host your website. It should work correctly!
